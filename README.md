## A Few Projects of Mine

### Homelab

I operate a fully containerized homelab environment utilizing IaC to manage a number of services. I have written documentation for each service, security configurations, and basic maintenance.

A work in progress.

### Devcontainers

Development environments that explicitly define and separate the required applications, tools, libraries, and runtimes that I need for working on different projects. These allow me to easily adapt, update, and reproduce them.
